<h2>Manual Installation (as an Add-On)</h2>

<p>After extracting the Add-On package, copy the files located in the <em>catalog</em> directory to your osCommerce installation directory on the server. The files must be copied in the correct directory structure as extracted from the Add-On package.</p>

<p>The file listing is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ext/modules/payment/sage_pay/errors.php</li>
  <li>includes/languages/english/modules/payment/sage_pay_form.php</li>
  <li>includes/modules/payment/sage_pay_form.php</li>
</ul>

<p>The standard language definitions in English are provided in the Add-On package. For additional languages, copy the English language definition file to the appropriate language directory and open the file with a text editor to edit the language definitions. The location of the language definition file must be in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>includes/languages/<em>LANGUAGE</em>/modules/payment/sage_pay_form.php</li>
</ul>

<p>When the files have been copied to their appropriate locations, the payment module will be available on the Administration Tool -> Modules -> Payment -> Install Module page where it can be installed, or on the Administration Tool -> Modules -> Payment page if the module was already previously installed.</p>

<p>If the module was already previously installed, it is important to visit the module configuration page to make sure new parameters are automatically installed in the database.</p>
