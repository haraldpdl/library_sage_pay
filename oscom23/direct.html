<p>The file listing is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ext/modules/payment/sage_pay/checkout.php</li>
  <li>ext/modules/payment/sage_pay/direct_3dauth.php</li>
  <li>ext/modules/payment/sage_pay/errors.php</li>

  <li>includes/languages/german/modules/payment/sage_pay_direct.php</li>
  <li>includes/modules/payment/sage_pay_direct.php</li>
</ul>

<p>The standard languages definitions in English, Spanish, and German are provided in the add-on package. For additional languages, copy one of the existing language definition files to the appropriate language directory and edit the file with a text editor to edit the language definitions. The location of the language definition file must be in:</p>
